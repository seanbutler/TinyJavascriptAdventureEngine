## Diving In

## Diving Right In

Lots of programming texts start with a bit of theory to get everyone thinking in the right way. From the perspective of a computer scientist that theory is really interesting. From the perspective of a new eager to learn programmer who knows nothing it can be less interesting and sometimes even comfusing. So, instead we are going to start by writing some code.

## Setting Up

Open a text editor on your machine. If you are comfortable and have installed your own favourite then use that (I use Atom or CLion or Visual Studio Code, depending on the job).

Completely new programmers should use the standard text editor for their platform.

> For windows that means notepad</br>
> linux using a terminal run nano</br>
> Macs have their own issues.

## Aside - Installing Atom

Atom is a pretty good text editor which runs on all of the above OSs. If you can, install Atom and lets get started.

## Aside - Difference Between Word Processors and Text Editors

A note on word processors. A word processor does not normally make text files. It creates a more complicated document that has fonts and formatting as well as the text.  For programming we want just the text, so you must use something like notepad or atom or nano.

## Using your web browser as a calculator

Run firefox.
Ctrl Shift K

This brings up a sub window of your browser called the console. The console is a place where you can type in text to give your browser information and instructions and it will give back responses as text (rather than via the webpage or GUI as you might be familiar with).

Click on the two >> and you should see a blinking cursor. Type in the following...


~~~ Javascript

>> 2+2

~~~

Then press enter/return, you should now see the following!

~~~ Javascript

>> 2+2
<- 4

~~~

Congratulations you just turned a computer costing £100s or £1000s and a web browser containing millions of lines of code into a simple calculator. Don't be too overwhelmed, this is just the first step we are starting with the least complicated thing we could. Soon it will be awesome and exciting.

Alright lets try something a little more complicated, brackets.

~~~ Javascript

>> 2+2*3
<- 8

>> (2+2)*3
<- 12

~~~

These sequences of numbers and symbols you are typing in are called arithmetic  _expressions_.  Each time you press enter/return through a translation process the computer evaluates the expression and gives us the answer back.

In the above example we used whole numbers, brackets and addition.

| plain english | computer term | symbols | what for |
|---|---|---|
| whole numbers | integers | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 | to represent the values of the natural numbers
| add | addition | + | the numbers one before and one after are added together
| times | multiply  | * | the numbers one before and one after are multiplied together
| brackets | parenthesis | ( ) | to change the ordering of the maths done


Now try a few more of your own devising.

~~~ Javascript

>> 2+2*3
<- 8

>> (2+2)*3
<- 12

~~~

In addition to what you see in the above table you can also use decimal numbers, all the usual maths operations and a host more things beside.

| plain english | computer term | symbols | what for |
|---|---|---|
| whole numbers | integer | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 | to represent the values of the natural numbers
| decimals | real | -99.999 ... 99.999 etc | to represent the values of the natural numbers
| plus | addition | + | the numbers one before and one after are added together
| minus | subtraction | + | the numbers one before and one after are added together
| times | multiply  | * | the numbers one before and one after are multiplied together
| over | divide  | * | the numbers one before and one after are multiplied together
| brackets | parenthesis | ( ) | to change the ordering of the maths done
| negative | unary minus  | * | the numbers one before and one after are multiplied together
| positive | unary plus  | * | the numbers one before and one after are multiplied together
