# Chapter 1

## Diving Right In

Lots of programming texts start with a bit of theory to get everyone thinking in the right way. From the perspective of a computer scientist that theory is really interesting. From the perspective of a new eager to learn programmer who knows nothing, less interesting. Instead we are going to start by writing some code.

Open a text editor on your machine. if you are comfortable and have installed your own favourite then use that (I use Atom or CLion or Visual Studio Code, depending on the job).

Completely new programmers should use the standard text editor for their platform.

> For windows that means notepad</br>
> linux using a terminal run nano</br>
> Macs have their own issues.

## Aside - Installing Atom

Atom is a pretty good basic editor which runs on all of the above OSs. If you can, install Atom and lets get started.

## Aside - Difference Between Word Processors and Text Editors

A note on word processors. A word processor is not a text edit.
