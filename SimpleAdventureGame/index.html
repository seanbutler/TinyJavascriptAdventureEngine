  <h1>Simple Adventure Game System</h1>
  <p>Simple engine.js interprets the data stored in a JSON object to present the game as a series of states and possible actions. For simple games you can use each state as a location and/or a story node. The events are the players choices. </p>
  <p>There are a couple of example games included in subdirectories. </p>
  <p>Source code is freely available on github for anyone to use and make their own adventures. </p>
